### An Introduction to Replit

An up-and-coming AI startup that interests me is Replit, a self-proclaimed “AI-driven software creation platform where everyone can build, share, and ship software fast.” My interest in their product and mission sparked after seeing a demo of theirs in San Francisco last year. Anecdotally, it was the first time I saw code being treated with the seamlessness and immediacy of design programs like Figma, but the intelligence and “best coding practices” of seasoned developers. It was apparent to me, as a product designer and novice to code, that this was the tool that could bridge the gap in coding education for product designers, and expedite timelines for experiences coders alike.

### What it does

Replit is an IDE (integrated development environment) that affords more collaborative development, blends natural language with natural code language, and uses its [Ghostwriter AI](https://blog.replit.com/ai4all) to debug, correct typing errors, and suggest changes to ensure development is not only fast, but correct and best practices. Replit allows multiple developers to work in the same environment while maintaining respective version control and machine learning assistance.

As recently as 2022, Replit switched to “the [Nix package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_(package_manager)) which allows users access to the entire Nixpkgs package database. New Repls can be created through official language templates or through a user's custom Nix configuration. Users can configure anything from the Language Server Protocol to debugger support for a Repl.” ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replit), via [source](https://blog.replit.com/powered-by-nix))

Originally Repl.it, founded in 2016 as a REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop), the company recently rebranded to Replit AI when David Hoang, CDO, joined founders Faris and Amjad Masad, with founding UX designer, Haya Odeh. The founders aspired to create a real-time coding environment online. In good business practice, they found a corner of the market, development education, to launch and have since expanded to generalized optimization for development.

### About the team

Amjad Masad is the founder. Prior to Replit, he built tools for Codecademy, Yahoo, and Facebook. Inspired by Google Docs ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replit)), he helped create JSRepl, the predecessor of Replit, which was an open-source program that compiled multiple languages into Javascript.

After raising in 2023, [Michele Catasta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pirroh/) joined Replit as VP of AI. Formerly “Head of Applied Research at Google Labs, [and before that] he was at Google X, where he researched Large Language Models applied to code. Michele has a Ph.D. in Computer Science and was Research Scientist and Instructor in AI at Stanford University.” ([source](https://blog.replit.com/replit-ai-manifesto)) With the addition of Michele, Replit was able to bolster their AI capabilities and approach the more establish development community outside the education space.

[David Hoang](https://davidhoang.com/) also recently joined as VP of marketing and design. Formerly Head of Design at Webflow and OneMedical, he has been leading the brand refresh to help with the most recent capital raise.

Currently Replit has over 180 employees and continues to scale.

### The Industry

While there are several direct competitors including GitHub Codespaces, Gitpod, VS Codespaces, Glitch and CodeSandbox, Replit is the only one to corner the AI market. AI development in the industry is still very new and incumbents like Replit are finding themselves in unique positions to pivot and scale quickly which has been made evident by both their recent increase in hiring and the most recent raising round. Replit is also differentiated in that with the collaboration and AI support, it has a lower barrier to entry compared to its competitors and is therefore suited for more beginner developers as well.

AI in the workplace and automating hardskills has been met with mixed feelings. Some are weary of it replacing skilled workers altogether, while others are finding creative ways to integrate it into their daily workflows. One agency has programmed their own chatbot to reflect their client’s preferences to anticipate feedback ([source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/podcasts/hard-fork-work-hank-green-deepfake.html)).

For Replit, users have continually sung praise for the AI-assisted development environment. One developer, Matt Palmer ([@mattppal](https://twitter.com/mattppal) on X) said: "Y'all the future of AI is wild, especially with tools like @groq and [@replit](https://twitter.com/Replit) .  With literally 55 lines of Python (thanks @Gradio, I built and deployed the fastest chatbot I've ever seen.)” ([source](https://twitter.com/mattppal/status/1789313103240519979)) Other developers on X have publicly voiced Replit as a necessity for [ai-native builder stacks](https://twitter.com/heyellieday/status/1788969898187890996).

### Growth

Recently, Replit raised about $97.4M, but is valuated at $1.16B ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cloud-developer-platform-replit-raises-97-4m-at-1-16b-valuation-to-further-its-lead-in-ai-development-and-continue-its-exponential-growth-301807085.html?tc=eml_cleartime)). The primary investor was Andreessen Horowitz of a16z who has reportedly invested in numerous AI platforms in recent years ([source](https://a16z.com/ai/)). Other investors include Khosla Ventures and Y Combinator, [according to Replit](https://blog.replit.com/b-extension). 

Because of the smallness of the company, paired with the zealousness of its users and community, the ease at which users can learn and use it, and the integration of AI ahead of its competitors, Replit has numerous opportunities to bolster their influence in the education sector, and lean into their community to innovate with open source projects.

### Opportunity

With the integration of AI, a shift in the design community in particular has already initiated a shift from “product designer” to “design engineers.” While this is culturally happening, programs like Rive, Webflow, Framer and other “No Code” programs have come in vogue in recent years further validating the shift from pure design, to generalist design engineers. With the addition of AI, something that is entirely developer based, these same designers are shifting further toward pure development.

Given Replit has a lower barrier to entry for code, and has Ghostwriter AI, I believe they have a unique opportunity to help this shift. In recent years, product design job opportunities have been in decline ([source](https://medium.com/@sushantvohra/the-thing-about-design-layoffs-ed8d0f91f997)). A quick google search, and the [AI overview](https://www.google.com/search?q=number+of+product+designers+laid+off+since+2022&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS923US923&oq=num&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCAgAEEUYJxg7MggIABBFGCcYOzIMCAEQABhDGIAEGIoFMgYIAhBFGDkyDAgDEAAYQxiABBiKBTIMCAQQABhDGIAEGIoFMgYIBRBFGD0yBggGEEUYPDIGCAcQRRg80gEIMTAxNGowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) shows you there have been about 450k designers laid off since 2022. For an industry based on hard skills that will be slowly replaced with generative AI, the job prospects for these designers are unclear. Coding is intimidating for this group of people, but there’s an opportunity for Replit to use their services to help them transition into design engineers and instead of being displaced by AI, they would instead ride the wave and afford themselves a whole corner of the job market. 

With the [recent collaboration with Figma](https://blog.replit.com/figma-to-replit) announced, it shows me that Replit is thinking similarly by bringing the coding environment to the design space, whereas Figma had previously been the resource designed to bring developers to design. Figma is a product design collaborative tool that allows multiple users to design and iterate in a single environment, just as Replit does for developers. Where Figma is more mature in its community efforts, it allows users to create, manipulate, and upload plugins for Figma that other designers can use and customize to aid their design to development pipelines. Replit allows similar customization, but had previously had a blocker from the design to the development. This integration tells me they’re thinking similarly, and are interested in capturing this audience and bringing new talent to the development space.

### Conclusion

Overall Replit is on a steep incline to being a dominant force in an emergent industry. With a strong product, usage of AI in a space that otherwise has not caught up, and the lower barrier to entry for non-developer persons, it has the chance to be the development environment for everyone, which is ultimately [their goal](https://blog.replit.com/ai4all).

As a product design generalist who was entrapped by the rounds of layoffs that took over my industry in the last few years, the opportunities that Replit can afford me, and the work they’re doing to improve otherwise gate-kept space, is something I’ve had my eye on, and greatly interests me.
